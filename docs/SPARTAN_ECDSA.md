# Spartan-ecdsa

Spartan-ecdsa (which to our knowledge) is the fastest open-source method to verify ECDSA (secp256k1) signatures in zero-knowledge. It can prove ECDSA group membership 10 times faster than [efficient-zk-ecdsa](https://github.com/personaelabs/efficient-zk-ecdsa), our previous implementation of fast ECDSA signature proving. Please refer to [this blog post](https://personaelabs.org/posts/spartan-ecdsa/) for further information.

## Constraint breakdown

spartan-ecdsa achieves the phenomenal result of **hashing becoming the bottleneck instead of ECC operations** for the `pubkey_membership.circom` circuit. In particular, there are **3,039** constraints for efficient ECDSA signature verification, and **5,037** constraints for a depth 20 merkle tree membership check + 1 Poseidon hash of the ECDSA public key. The drop from the original 1.5 million constraints of [circom-ecdsa](https://github.com/0xPARC/circom-ecdsa) comes primarily from doing right-field arithmetic with secq and avoiding SNARK-unfriendly range checks and big integer math.

We also use [efficient ECDSA signatures](https://personaelabs.org/posts/efficient-ecdsa-1/) instead of standard ECDSA siagnatures to save an additional **14,505** constraints. To review, the standard ECDSA signature consists of $(r, s)$ for a public key $Q_a$ and message $m$, where $r$ is the x-coordinate of a random elliptic curve point $R$. Standard ECDSA signature verification checks if

```math
R == m s ^{-1} * G + r s ^{-1} * Q_a
```

where $G$ is the generator point of the curve. The efficient ECDSA signature consists of $s$ as well as $T = r^{-1} * R$ and $U = -r^{-1} * m * G$, which can both be computed outside of the SNARK without breaking correctness. Efficient ECDSA signature verification checks if

```math
s * T + U == Q_a
```

Thus, verifying a standard ECDSA signature instead of the efficient ECDSA signature requires (1) computing $s^{-1}$, $r \* s^{-1}$, $m \* s^{-1}$, and (2) an extra ECC scalar multiply to compute $m s ^{-1} * G$. The former computations happen in the scalar field of secp, which is unequal to the scalar field of secq, and so we incur 11,494 additional constraints for the wrong-field math. The latter can use the `Secp256k1Mul` subroutine and incurs 3,011 additional constraints.
