# Prfs

Prfs is a software library and API enabling **creating and sharing** proofs in zero-knowledge.

Zero-knowledge proofs, especially in a consumer grade machine, don't get created as fast as they
could. Speed aside, it entails mathematical concepts that are not readily comprehensible.

Prfs API abstracts away the **cryptographic inner workings** and are designed to be executed
**reasonably fast** in the client side. In this documentation, we will walk you through the core
concepts and functionalities Prfs provide.
